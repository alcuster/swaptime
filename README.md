# Swaptime

Swaptime is an Angular 2 + MeteorJS web app for trading courses within a university online.
I created this app for my senior thesis in Digital Studies at Davidson College.

The app is an evolving manifestation of my continued research in user privacy and trust, and how
developers can promote these values in community technologies (platforms that target a
geographically bound community.)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this app on your own machine, you need to first:
* [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install?__hstc=219992390.46c261644920ab8d7e8eca43b17981dc.1491235699484.1492813484389.1492878315108.6&__hssc=219992390.4.1492878315108&__hsfp=2214220125)
* Install all NPM dependencies by executing
